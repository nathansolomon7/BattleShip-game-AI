This is a battleship game program (written in MATLAB) that is meant to emulate a battleship board at the start of the game, as the program attempts to find the battleships in as few moves as possible. The program works by querying random moves on the grid until a ship is hit, where it will then search for the direction the remaining squares of the ship lies and continue hitting the ship until it has been sunk. 
The first function, "playGameHW5" is the battleship algorithm. To see the program run on a 10x10 grid, run the file "testProgram".
